    Testing correctness of xml output (API version v1).

    Scenario Outline: Reverse XML - Simple reverse-geocoding with no results
        When sending v1/reverse
          | lat   | lon   |
          | <lat> | <lon> |
        Then a HTTP 200 is returned
        And the result is valid xml
        And the result has no attributes osm_type, address, extratags
        And the result contains
          | error |
          | Unable to geocode |
